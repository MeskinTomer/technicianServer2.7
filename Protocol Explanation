A simple protocol designed to send and receive messages from a client to a server and vice versa. Each message is made
of a command, which represents the intended action, and the content needed to be sent in order for the action or
the response.

Diagram of how the protocol shapes the message in order to be sent:

Command Length + End Mark + Command + Payload Length + End Mark + Payload

Command Length: The length needed in order to receive the command - the length of the command
Command: The command itself
Payload Length: The length needed in order to receive the payload - the length of the payload
Payload: The payload itself
End Mark: A simple char used to alert when the process of receiving the length of the command/payload needs to be stopped
